# ByteEats

## Description

ByteEats was designed to create an inclusive and efficient takeout ordering system for individuals with hearing and vocal impairments. The motivation behind this project was to improve accessibility in food service by allowing customers to place orders independently without verbal communication. This project places a huge emphasis on Python data structures and basics such as conditionals, loops, and handling user input.
